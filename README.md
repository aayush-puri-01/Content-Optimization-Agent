## System Architecture

In this architecture, each tool operates as an independent agent with specific expertise, while loose coupling allows for easy extension and modification.The LLM Router acts as a central coordinator. Steps are generated based on user requirements, not pre-defined which allows felexible execution order with dependency management.

## Running the API Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Ensure your `main.py` contains FastAPI app setup and includes the campaign route.

### Request Body

```json
{
  "prompt": "Generate a complete campaign for sunglasses brand for Gen Z in a humorous tone"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "formatted_output": "=== ðŸ“£ Campaign Overview ===\nðŸŽ¯ Theme: ..."
}
```

---

## Making Requests from Terminal (with `jq`)

You can use `curl` and `jq` to make requests directly from your terminal and format the output cleanly.

### Install `jq` (if not already)

- Ubuntu/Debian:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install jq
  ```

- macOS (Homebrew):

  ```bash
  brew install jq
  ```

---

### Example Usage

```bash
curl -s -X POST 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/agent/query' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "Generate a complete campaign for sunglasses brand for Gen Z in a humorous tone"
  }' | jq -r '.formatted_output'
```

This command sends the prompt and prints only the `formatted_output` (the campaign content) to your terminal in a clean, readable format.

## Dependencies

This project uses [`uv`](https://pypi.org/project/uv/) as the package manager. To install all dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

You can also place those dependencies in a `requirements.txt` and install accordingly:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
